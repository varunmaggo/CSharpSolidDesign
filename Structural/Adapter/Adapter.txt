Definition

Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

Frequency of use: Medium high




The classes and objects participating in this pattern are:

Target   (Army)
- defines the domain-specific interface that Client uses.

Adapter   (NinjaArmy)
- adapts the interface Adaptee to the Target interface.

Adaptee   (Dojo)
- defines an existing interface that needs adapting.

Client   (Main Method)
- collaborates with objects conforming to the Target interface.
