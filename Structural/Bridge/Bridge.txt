Definition

Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

Frequency of use: Medium




The classes and objects participating in this pattern are:

Abstraction   (Printer)
- defines the abstraction's interface.
- maintains a reference to an object of type Implementor.

RefinedAbstraction   (Epson)
- extends the interface defined by Abstraction.

Implementor   (PrinterFormat)
- defines the interface for implementation classes. This interface doesn't have to correspond exactly to Abstraction's interface; in fact the two interfaces can be quite different. 
- Typically the Implementation interface provides only primitive operations, and Abstraction defines higher-level operations based on these primitives.

ConcreteImplementor   (HtmlFormat, PlainTextFormat)
- implements the Implementor interface and defines its concrete implementation.
