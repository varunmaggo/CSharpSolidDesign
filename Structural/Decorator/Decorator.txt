Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

Frequency of use:Medium





The classes and objects participating in this pattern are:

Component   
- defines the interface for objects that can have responsibilities added to them dynamically.

ConcreteComponent   
- defines an object to which additional responsibilities can be attached.

Decorator   
- maintains a reference to a Component object and defines an interface that conforms to Component's interface.

ConcreteDecorator   
- adds responsibilities to the component.
