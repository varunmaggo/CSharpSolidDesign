Definition

Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

Frequency of use: Medium low




The classes and objects participating in this pattern are:

Builder  (SmartphoneBuilder)
- specifies an abstract interface for creating parts of a Product object

ConcreteBuilder  (MilleniumSmartphoneBuilder, WaterproofSmartphnoeBuilder)
- constructs and assembles parts of the product by implementing the Builder interface
- defines and keeps track of the representation it creates
- provides an interface for retrieving the product

Director  (Manufacturer)
- constructs an object using the Builder interface

Product  (Smartphone)
- represents the complex object under construction. ConcreteBuilder builds the product's internal representation and defines the process by which it's assembled
- includes classes that define the constituent parts, including interfaces for assembling the parts into the final result
