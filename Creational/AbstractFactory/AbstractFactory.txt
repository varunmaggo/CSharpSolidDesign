Definition

Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Frequency of use: High




The classes and objects participating in this pattern are:

AbstractFactory  (CastleFactory)
- declares an interface for operations that create abstract products

ConcreteFactory   (HaiwaCastle, KatanaCastle)
- implements the operations to create concrete product objects

AbstractProduct   (Attacker, Defender)
- declares an interface for a type of product object

Product  (Ninjas, Orks, Pirates, Samurai, Golumns)
- defines a product object to be created by the corresponding concrete factory
- implements the AbstractProduct interface

Client  (Battle)
- uses interfaces declared by AbstractFactory and AbstractProduct classes
